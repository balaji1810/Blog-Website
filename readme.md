# IEEE-Website

* Hello, This is a sample blog website that I created using Node.js with EJS templating and MongoDB.

## Installation

* Download the zip file of my code from GitHub and extract all the files from it.
* You need MongoDB configured in your system.

## How to Run

cd to the websites directory and run the following command
```bash
npm i
```
and then,
```bash
node app.js
```
you should get a message like this,
```bash
Server started on port 3000!
```
View the website on chrome with http://localhost:3000/ as the address.
